library weekday_selector;

// Ideas:
// * List picker like on the iOS Clock or Google Calendar recurring events
// * Verify A11y OK? focus nodes, autofocus, semantics enabled, screen readers,
// * a11y: how should selected status be announced?
// * what happens if onChanged is null? Buttons should be disabled
// * Support forms: accept the same parameters as simple selector,
//   we are going to need a controller and display errors.
// * How it works on the web? Keyboard support? Tabs to jump and space toggle.
